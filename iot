IOT means the things, for example, phones, laptops, TV and fridge, that have the ability to connect to the internet and share data
We have a device that collects data from its surroundings, using sensors and actuators, and sends this collected data to the internet where the processing of the data can happen. 
IOT has four layers, the first layer is the sensing slash device, which has sensors and actuators that collect data from surroundings based on specific function. After the data has been collected through the sensing device layer, it goes to the connectivity layer, very descent to the cloud using the Internet. This connection is generally made through one of the methods like via WIFI, or Bluetooth cellular. After that comes to data processing layer. Now the data, once it reaches the cloud, we should analyse the data. The different types of algorithms are used based on the type of data collected and other assumptions to get meaningful insights and patterns, then a decision is made based on the insights gain. User interface and application is the last layer. 

An IoT cloud is a vast network that supports IoT devices and applications. This includes the underlying infrastructure, servers and storage required for real-time operations and processing. The IoT cloud also includes the services and standards necessary to connect, manage, and secure various IoT devices and applications. IoT cloud platforms bring together capabilities of IoT devices and cloud computing delivered as a end-to-end service. IOT cloud can do device management, system management, data management, analytics, deployment management, visualization, research and application development. Cloud for IoT can be employed in three ways: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
